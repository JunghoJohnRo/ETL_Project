    "#### Data Sources\n",
    "We initially found an NFL arrests API and found the source from which the API was pulling data, USA Today (https://www.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/arrests/). To connect arrests with any consequences players would have faced after their arrests within the NFL, we pulled a table of NFL suspensions from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suspensions_in_the_National_Football_League). The NFL arrests data contained only the team abbreviations and the suspensions table contained only the full team name. We scraped a list of NFL team names and abbreviations from Quizlet (https://quizlet.com/80005100/nfl-teams-by-abbreviation-flash-cards/)."
